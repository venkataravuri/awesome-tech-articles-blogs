## Probabilistic Data Structures

- Probabilistic data structures and algorithms (PDSA) are a family of advanced approaches that are _*optimized to use fixed or sublinear memory and constant execution time*_.
- They are often based on hashing and have many other useful features.- However, they also have some disadvantages such as they cannot provide the exact answers and have some probability of error (that, actually, can be controlled).

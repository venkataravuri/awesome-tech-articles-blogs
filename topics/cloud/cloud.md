 Cloud governance policies affect architecture, deployment, maintenance ...
 
 Governance is essentially the activity of defining, continuously monitoring, and auditing the rules, guidelines, policies, and processes that allocate, coordinate, and control a given operation's resources and actions.


Some governance rules could include:

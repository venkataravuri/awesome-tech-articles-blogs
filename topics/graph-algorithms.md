Design a train system which suggests shortest path and transfer needed to reach from source to destination. What can be the optimization.
For example: A system may have 10 trains from t1 to t10. There are total 100 stops in the system s1 to s100. Each train has fixed set of stops. You could allow to change and transfer train of source and destination does not cover using just 1 train.
What all can be APIs, data structure, optimizations scalable option.
